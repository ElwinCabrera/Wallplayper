# Wallpaper Maker 
Group Project for CSE422 - Software Engineering with Matthew Hertz


Program that will automatically set the desktop wallpaper on computer. Will pull images from reddit and set them as a wallpaper automatically. Will have options such as...

* Updating wallpaper at specified time intervals
* Selecting specific subreddits you can pull images from
* NSFW Filter for content
* Option to save images to local file system
* Dark Mode because it's superior to bright interfaces
